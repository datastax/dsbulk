  # CSV Connector configuration.
  connector.csv {

    # The URL or path of the resource(s) to read from or write to.
    #
    # Which URL protocols are available depend on which URL stream handlers have been installed, but at least the **file** protocol is guaranteed to be supported for reads and writes, and the **http** and **https** protocols are guaranteed to be supported for reads.
    #
    # The file protocol can be used with all supported file systems, local or not.
    # - When reading: the URL can point to a single file, or to an existing directory; in case of a directory, the *fileNamePattern* setting can be used to filter files to read, and the *recursive* setting can be used to control whether or not the connector should look for files in subdirectories as well.
    # - When writing: the URL will be treated as a directory; if it doesn't exist, the loader will attempt to create it; CSV files will be created inside this directory, and their names can be controlled with the *fileNameFormat* setting.
    #
    # Note that if the value specified here does not have a protocol, then it is assumed to be a file protocol. Relative URLs will be resolved against the current working directory. Also, for convenience, if the path begins with a tilde (`~`), that symbol will be expanded to the current user's home directory.
    #
    # In addition the value `-` indicates `stdin` when loading and `stdout` when unloading. This is in line with Unix tools such as tar, which uses `-` to represent stdin/stdout when reading/writing an archive.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #     url = "/path/to/dir/or/file"           # without protocol
    #     url = "./path/to/dir/or/file"          # without protocol, relative to working directory
    #     url = "~/path/to/dir/or/file"          # without protocol, relative to the user's home directory
    #     url = "file:///path/to/dir/or/file"    # with file protocol
    #     url = "http://acme.com/file.csv"       # with HTTP protocol
    #     url = "-"                              # to read csv data from stdin (for load) or
    #     url = "-"                              # write csv data to stdout (for unload)
    #
    # For other URLs: the URL will be read or written directly; settings like *fileNamePattern*, *recursive*, and *fileNameFormat* will have no effect.
    #
    # The default value is `-` (read from `stdin` / write to `stdout`).
    url = "-"

    # The URL or path of the file that contains the list of resources to read from.
    #
    # The file specified here should be located on the local filesystem.

    # This setting and `connector.csv.url` are mutually exclusive. If both are defined and non empty, this setting takes precedence over `connector.csv.url`.

    # The file with URLs should follow this format:
    # /path/to/file/file.csv
    # /path/to.dir/
    #
    # Every line should contain one path. You don't need to escape paths in this file.
    # All the remarks for connector.csv.url apply for each line in the file, and especially, settings like fileNamePattern, recursive, and fileNameFormat all apply to each line individually.
    #
    # You can comment out a line in the URL file by making it start with a # sign:
    # #/path/that/will/be/ignored
    #
    # Such a line will be ignored.

    # For your convenience every line in the urlfile will be trimmed - that is any leading and trailing white space will be removed.
