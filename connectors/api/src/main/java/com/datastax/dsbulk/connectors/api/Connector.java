/**
 * A Connector is a component capable of reading from and writing to a datasource.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation guidelines</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Lifecycle</strong>
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of a connector is as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #configure(LoaderConfig, boolean)}
 *   <li>{@link #init()}
 *   <li>{@link #read()} or {@link #write()}
 *   <li>{@link #close()}
 * </ol>
 *
 * Connectors are allowed to be stateful. DSBulk will always preserve the order of method
 * invocations outlined above. It will never reuse a connector for more than one operation, and will
 * never perform both a read and a write operation on the same connector instance.
 *
 * <p>When reading, connectors act as publishers and emit data read from their datasources as a flow
 * of {@link Record}s; when writing, connectors act as a transforming function: they receive {@link
 * Record}s from an upstream publisher, write them to the external datasource, then re-emit them to
 * downstream subscribers.
 *
 * <p><strong>Read operations</strong>
 *
 * <p>Read operations return {@link Supplier}s of {@link Publisher}s.
 *
 * <p>All publishers are guaranteed to be subscribed only once; implementors are allowed to optimize
 * for single-subscriber use cases. Implementors are also allowed to memoize suppliers.
 *
 * <p>Reading by resource: connectors that are able to distinguish natural boundaries when reading
 * (e.g. when reading from more than one file, or reading from more than one database table) should
 * implement {@link #readByResource()} by emitting their records grouped by such resources; this
 * allows DSBulk to optimize read operations, and is specially valuable if records in the original
 * dataset are grouped by partition key inside each resource, because this natural grouping can thus
 * be preserved. If, however, there is no distinguishable boundaries in the dataset, then this
 * method can be derived from the {@link #read()} method, for example (using Reactor Framework):
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Supplier&lt;? extends Publisher&lt;Publisher&lt;Record&gt;&gt;&gt; readByResource() {
 *  return () -&gt; Flux.just(read().get());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * DSBulk also optimizes reads according to the number of resources to read. Implementors should
 * implement {@link #estimatedResourceCount()} carefully.
 *
 * <p><strong>Write operations</strong>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #write()} operation returns a {@link Function} that transforms {@link Publisher}s.
 *
 * <p>Implementors should transform streams such that each record is written to the destination,
 * then re-emitted to downstream subscribers, e.g. (pseudo-code using the Reactor Framework):
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Function&lt;? super Publisher&lt;Record&gt;, ? extends Publisher&lt;Record&gt;&gt; write() {
 *   return upstream -&gt; {
 *     return Flux.from(upstream)
 *       .doOnNext(writer::write)
 *       .doOnTerminate(writer::close);
 *   };
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The transformed publisher is guaranteed to be subscribed only once; implementors are allowed
 * to optimize for single-subscriber use cases. Implementors are also allowed to memoize the
 * transforming functions.
 *
 * <p><strong>Error handling</strong>
 *
 * <p>Unrecoverable errors (i.e., errors that put the connector in an unstable state, or in a state
 * where no subsequent records can be read or written successfully) should be emitted as {@code
 * onError} signals to downstream subscribers. DSBulk will abort the operation immediately.
 *
 * <p>Recoverable errors however (i.e., errors that do not comprise the connector's ability to emit
 * further records successfully) should be converted to {@link ErrorRecord}s and emitted as such.
 * This way, DSBulk is able to detect such errors and treat them accordingly (for example, by
 * redirecting them to a "bad file" or by updating a counter of errors).
