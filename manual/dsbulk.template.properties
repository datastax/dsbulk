# Connector-specific settings. This section contains settings for the connector to use; it also
# contains sub-sections, one for each available connector.
###################################################################################################

# The name of the connector to use.
# 
# It is used in two places:
# 
# 1. The path to the group of settings for the connector are located under `connector.<name>`.
# 2. The connector class name must start with `name`, case-insensitively. It is permitted for `name`
# to be the fully-qualified class name of the connector. That simply implies that the settings root
# will be at that fully-qualified location.
# 
# Example: `csv` for class `CSVConnector`, with settings located under `connector.csv`.
# Type: string
# Default value: "csv"
#connector.name = "csv"


###################################################################################################
# Reference configuration for the CSV Connector.
# 
# Note that a paragraph is written in one line, and paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
# This has the benefit of rendering well in markdown as well as plain-text help output (since
# the help text formatter wraps lines appropriately).
###################################################################################################

# The URL or path of the resource(s) to read from or write to.
# 
# Which URL protocols are available depend on which URL stream handlers have been installed, but at
# least the following are guaranteed to be supported:
# 
# - **stdin**:  the stdin protocol can be used to read from standard input; the only valid URL for
# this protocol is: `stdin:/`.
# 
# This protocol cannot be used for writing.
# 
# - **stdout**: the stdout protocol can be used to write to standard output; the only valid URL for
# this protocol is: `stdout:/`.
# 
# This protocol cannot be used for reading.
# 
# - **file**: the file protocol can be used with all supported file systems, local or not.
# - **When reading**: the URL can point to a single file, or to an existing directory; in case of a
# directory, the *fileNamePattern* setting can be used to filter files to read, and the *recursive*
# setting can be used to control whether or not the connector should look for files in subdirectories
# as well.
# - **When writing**: the URL will be treated as a directory; if it doesn't exist, the loader will
# attempt to create it; CSV files will be created inside this directory, and their names can be
# controlled with the *fileNameFormat* setting.
# 
# Note that if the value specified here does not have a protocol, then it is assumed to be a file
# protocol.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# url = /path/to/dir/or/file           # without protocol
# url = "file:///path/to/dir/or/file"  # with protocol
# url = "stdin:/"                      # to read csv data from stdin
# url = "stdout:/"                     # to write csv data to stdout
# 
# For other URLs: the URL will be read or written directly; settings like *fileNamePattern*,
# *recursive*, and *fileNameFormat* will have no effect.
# 
# This setting has no default value and must be supplied by the user.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#connector.csv.url = ""

# The character to use as field delimiter.
# 
# Only one character can be specified. Note that this setting applies to all files to be read or
# written.
# Type: string
# Default value: ","
#connector.csv.delimiter = ","

# Whether the files to read or write begin with a header line or not.
# 
# When reading:
# 
# - if set to true, the first non-empty line in every file is discarded, even if the *skipLines*
# setting is set to zero (see below). However, that line will be used to assign field names to each
# record, thus allowing mappings by field name such as `{myFieldName1 = myColumnName1, myFieldName2 =
# myColumnName2}`.
# - if set to false, records will not contain field names, only (zero-based) field indexes; in this
# case, the mapping should be index-based, such as in `{0 = myColumnName1, 1 = myColumnName2}`.
# 
# When writing:
# 
# - if set to true: each file will begin with a header line;
# - if set to false, files will not contain header lines.
# 
# Note that this setting applies to all files to be read or written.
# Type: boolean
# Default value: true
#connector.csv.header = true

# Defines a number of lines to skip from each input file before the parser can begin to execute.
# 
# Ignored when writing.
# Type: number
# Default value: 0
#connector.csv.skipLines = 0

# Defines the maximum number of lines to read from or write to each file.
# 
# When reading, all lines past this number will be discarded.
# 
# When writing, a file will contain at most this number of lines; if more records remain to be
# written, a new file will be created using the *fileNameFormat* setting.
# 
# Note that when writing to anything other than a directory, this setting is ignored.
# 
# This setting takes into account the *header* setting: if a file begins with a header line, that line
# is counted.
# 
# This feature is disabled by default (indicated by its `-1` value).
# Type: number
# Default value: -1
#connector.csv.maxLines = -1

# The character that represents a line comment when found in the beginning of a line of text.
# 
# Only one character can be specified. Note that this setting applies to all files to be read or

# The file name format to use when writing.
# 
# Ignored when reading. Ignored for non-file URLs.

# Type: string
# Default value: "output-%0,6d.csv"
#connector.csv.fileNameFormat = "output-%0,6d.csv"

# The glob pattern to use when searching for files to read. The syntax to use is the glob syntax, as
# described in `java.nio.file.FileSystem.getPathMatcher()`.
# 
# Ignored when writing. Ignored for non-file URLs.
# 
# Only applicable when the *url* setting points to a directory on a known filesystem, ignored
# otherwise.
# Type: string
# Default value: "**/*.csv"
#connector.csv.fileNamePattern = "**/*.csv"

# The maximum number of reading or writing threads. In other words, this setting controls how many
# files can be read or written simultaneously.
# Type: number
# Default value: 4
#connector.csv.maxThreads = 4

# The character used for quoting fields when the field delimiter is part of the field value.
# 
# Only one character can be specified. Note that this setting applies to all files to be read or

# Type: string
# Default value: "\""

###################################################################################################
# Schema-specific settings.
###################################################################################################

# The keyspace to connect to. Optional.
# 
# If not specified, then the *schema.query* setting must be specified.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#schema.keyspace = ""

# The destination table. Optional.
# 
# If not specified, then the *schema.query* setting must be specified.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#schema.table = ""

# The field-to-column mapping to use.
# 
# Applies to both load and unload workflows.
# 
# If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the source fields and
# the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an explicit mapping.
# 
# Mappings should be specified as a HOCON map
# (https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) of the following form:
# 
# - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, etc. are the zero-based
# indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the
# insert statement.
# - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`, `fieldB`,
# `fieldC`, etc. are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable
# names in the insert statement.
# 
# In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be partly
# auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields c1, c2, c3,
# and c5, and the table has columns c1, c2, c3, c4, one can map all like-named columns and specify
# that c5 in the source maps to c4 in the table as follows: `* = *, c5 = c4`
# 
# One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for c2: `* = -c2`
# 
# To skip c2 and c3: `* = [-c2, -c3]`
# 
# To only map c1 and c2: `* = [c1, c2]`
# 
# The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only
# produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing
# both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know
# which kinds of mapping it supports.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#schema.mapping = ""

# Case-sensitive strings (in the form of a comma-delimited list) that should be mapped to `null`.
# 
# In load workflows, when a record field value matches one of these words, then that value is replaced
# with a `null` and forwarded to DSE as such.
# 
# This setting only applies for fields of type String.
# 
# Note that this setting is applied before the *schema.nullToUnset* setting, hence any `null`s
# produced by a null-string can still be left unset if required.
# 
# In unload workflows, only the first string specified here will be used: when a row cell contains a
# `null` value, then it will be replaced with that word and forwarded as such to the connector.
# 
# By default, empty strings are converted to `null`s in load workflows, and conversely `null`s are
# converted to empty strings in unload workflows.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#schema.nullStrings = ""

# Whether or not to map `null` input values to "unset" in the database, meaning don't modify a
# potentially pre-existing value of this field for this row.
# 
# This is only valid for load scenarios; it is ignored otherwise.
# 
# Note that this setting is applied after the *schema.nullStrings* setting, and may intercept `null`s
# produced by that setting.
# 
# Note that setting this to false leads to tombstones being created in the database to represent
# `null`.
# Type: boolean
# Default value: true
#schema.nullToUnset = true

# The query to use. Optional.
# 
# If not specified, then *schema.keyspace* and *schema.table* must be specified, and dsbulk will infer
# the appropriate statement based on the table's metadata, using all available columns.
# 
# In load worflows, the statement can be any `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement, but **must** use named
# bound variables exclusively; positional bound variables will not work.
# 
# Bound variable names usually match those of the columns in the destination table, but this is not a
# strict requirement; it is, however, required that their names match those specified in the mapping.
# 
# See *schema.mapping* setting for more information.
# 
# In unload worflows, the statement can be any regular `SELECT` statement; it can optionally contain a
# token range restriction clause of the form: `token(...) > :start and token(...) <= :end.`
# 
# If such a clause is present, the engine will generate as many statements as there are token ranges
# in the cluster, thus allowing parallelization of reads while at the same time targeting coordinators
# that are also replicas.
# 
# The column names in the SELECT clause will be used to match column names specified in the mapping.
# See "mapping" setting for more information.
# Type: string
# Default value: ""
#schema.query = ""

# Record metadata.
# 
# Applies within both load and unload workflows to records being respectively read from or written to
# the connector.
# 
# This information is optional, and rarely needed.
# 
# If not specified:
# 
# - If the connector is capable of reporting the record metadata accurately (for example, some
# database connectors might be able to inspect the target table's metadata), then this section is only
# required if you want to override some field types as reported by the connector.
# - If the connector is not capable of reporting the record metadata accurately (for example, file
# connectors usually cannot report such information), then all fields are assumed to be of type
# `String`. If this is not correct, then you need to provide the correct type information here.
# 
# Field metadata should be specified as a HOCON map
# (https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) of the following form:
# 
# - Indexed data sources: `0 = java.lang.String, 1 = java.lang.Double`, where `0`, `1`, etc. are the
# zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and the values are the expected types for each
# field.
# - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = java.lang.String, fieldB = java.lang.Double`, where `fieldA`,
# `fieldB`, etc. are field names in the source data; and the values are the expected types for each
# field.
