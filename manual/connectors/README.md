# DataStax Bulk Loader/Unloader Connectors

[Connectors] are responsible for connecting to an external source of data and extracting 
that data in the form of [Records], for downstream consumption by the loader workflow engine.

Connectors are created by implementing the `Connector` interface. They are then discovered through
the Service Loader API.
