# This is a template configuration file for the DataStax Bulk Loader (DSBulk).
#
# This file is written in HOCON format; see
# https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
# for more information on its syntax.
#
# Please make sure you've read the DataStax Bulk Loader documentation included in this binary
# distribution:
# ../manual/README.md
#
# An exhaustive list of available settings can be found here:
# ../manual/settings.md
#
# Also, two template configuration files meant to be used together can be found here:
# ../manual/application.template.conf
# ../manual/driver.template.conf
#
# We recommend that this file be named application.conf and placed in the /conf directory; these
# are indeed the default file name and path where DSBulk looks for configuration files.
#
# To use other file names, or another folder, you can use the -f command line switch; consult the

# DataStax Java Driver settings.
#
# You can declare any Java Driver settings directly in this file, but for maintainability sake, we
# placed them in a separate file, which is expected to be named driver.conf and located in the same
# /conf directory.
# Use that file, for example, to define contact points, provide authentication and encryption
# settings, modify timeouts, consistency levels, page sizes, policies, and much more.
# If you decide to declare the driver settings in a different way, or in a file named differently,
# make sure to test your setup to ensure that all settings are correctly detected.
#
# You can also consult the Java Driver online documentation for more details:

    # The URL or path of the resource(s) to read from or write to.
    # 
    # Which URL protocols are available depend on which URL stream handlers have been installed, but
    # at least the **file** protocol is guaranteed to be supported for reads and writes, and the
    # **http** and **https** protocols are guaranteed to be supported for reads.
    # 
    # The file protocol can be used with all supported file systems, local or not.
    # - When reading: the URL can point to a single file, or to an existing directory; in case of a
    # directory, the *fileNamePattern* setting can be used to filter files to read, and the
    # *recursive* setting can be used to control whether or not the connector should look for files
    # in subdirectories as well.
    # - When writing: the URL will be treated as a directory; if it doesn't exist, the loader will
    # attempt to create it; CSV files will be created inside this directory, and their names can be
    # controlled with the *fileNameFormat* setting.
    # 
    # Note that if the value specified here does not have a protocol, then it is assumed to be a
    # file protocol. Relative URLs will be resolved against the current working directory. Also, for
    # convenience, if the path begins with a tilde (`~`), that symbol will be expanded to the
    # current user's home directory.
    # 
    # In addition the value `-` indicates `stdin` when loading and `stdout` when unloading. This is
    # in line with Unix tools such as tar, which uses `-` to represent stdin/stdout when
    # reading/writing an archive.
    # 
    # Examples:
    # 
    # url = "/path/to/dir/or/file"           # without protocol
    # url = "./path/to/dir/or/file"          # without protocol, relative to working directory
    # url = "~/path/to/dir/or/file"          # without protocol, relative to the user's home
    # directory
    # url = "file:///path/to/dir/or/file"    # with file protocol
    # url = "http://acme.com/file.csv"       # with HTTP protocol
    # url = "-"                              # to read csv data from stdin (for load) or
    # url = "-"                              # write csv data to stdout (for unload)
    # 
    # For other URLs: the URL will be read or written directly; settings like *fileNamePattern*,
    # *recursive*, and *fileNameFormat* will have no effect.
    # 
    # The default value is `-` (read from `stdin` / write to `stdout`).
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "-"
    #connector.csv.url = "-"

    # The character(s) to use as field delimiter. Field delimiters containing more than one
    # character are accepted.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: ","
    #connector.csv.delimiter = ","

    # Enable or disable whether the files to read or write begin with a header line. If enabled for
    # loading, the first non-empty line in every file will assign field names for each record
    # column, in lieu of `schema.mapping`, `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`. If
    # disabled for loading, records will not contain fields names, only field indexes, `0 = col1, 1
    # = col2, 2 = col3`. For unloading, if this setting is enabled, each file will begin with a
    # header line, and if disabled, each file will not contain a header line.

    #connector.csv.skipRecords = 0

    # The maximum number of records to read from or write to each file. When reading, all records
    # past this number will be discarded. When writing, a file will contain at most this number of

    # *fileNameFormat* setting. Note that when writing to anything other than a directory, this
    # setting is ignored. This setting takes into account the *header* setting: if a file begins

    # 
    # If compression is enabled, the default value for this setting will be modified to include the

    # empty, this setting takes precedence over `connector.csv.url`.
    # 
    # This setting applies only when loading. When unloading, this setting should be left empty or
    # set to null; any non-empty value will trigger a fatal error.

    # 
    # ```
    # /path/to/file/file.csv
    # /path/to.dir/
    # ```
    # 
    # Every line should contain one path. You don't need to escape paths in this file.
    # 
    # All the remarks for `connector.csv.url` apply for each line in the file, and especially,
    # settings like `fileNamePattern`, `recursive`, and `fileNameFormat` all apply to each line
    # individually.
    # 
    # You can comment out a line in the URL file by making it start with a # sign:
    # 
    # ```
    # #/path/that/will/be/ignored

    # Such a line will be ignored.
    # 
    # For your convenience, every line in the urlfile will be trimmed - that is, any leading and
    # trailing white space will be removed.

    # The field-to-column mapping to use, that applies to both loading and unloading; ignored when
    # counting. If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the
    # source fields and the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an
    # explicit mapping. Mappings should be specified as a map of the following form:
    # 
    # - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, are the
    # zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable
    # names in the insert statement.
    # - A shortcut to map the first `n` fields is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1,
    # col2, col3`.
    # - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`,
    # `fieldB`, `fieldC`, are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound
    # variable names in the insert statement.
    # - A shortcut to map fields named like columns is to simply specify the destination columns:
    # `col1, col2, col3`.
    # 
    # To specify that a field should be used as the timestamp (a.k.a. write-time) or ttl (a.k.a.
    # time-to-live) of the inserted row, use the specially named fake columns `__ttl` and
    # `__timestamp`: `fieldA = __timestamp, fieldB = __ttl`. Note that Timestamp fields are parsed
    # as regular CQL timestamp columns and must comply with either `codec.timestamp`, or
    # alternatively, with `codec.unit` + `codec.epoch`. TTL fields are parsed as integers
    # representing durations in seconds, and must comply with `codec.number`.
    # 
    # To specify that a column should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the
    # function call as the input field (e.g. `now() = c4`). Note, this is only relevant for load
    # operations. Similarly, to specify that a field should be populated with the result of a
    # function call, specify the function call as the input column (e.g. `field1 = now()`). This is
    # only relevant for unload operations. Function calls can also be qualified by a keyspace name:
    # `field1 = ks1.max(c1,c2)`.
    # 
    # In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be
    # partly auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields
    # `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c5`, and the table has columns `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, one can map all
    # like-named columns and specify that `c5` in the source maps to `c4` in the table as follows:
    # `* = *, c5 = c4`.
    # 
    # One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for `c2`: `* = -c2`. To skip `c2`
    # and `c3`: `* = [-c2, -c3]`.
    # 
    # Any identifier, field or column, that is not strictly alphanumeric (i.e. not matching
    # `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`) must be surrounded by double-quotes, just like you would do in CQL: `"Field
    # ""A""" = "Column 2"` (to escape a double-quote, simply double it). Note that, contrary to the
    # CQL grammar, unquoted identifiers will not be lower-cased: an identifier such as `MyColumn1`
    # will match a column named `"MyColumn1"` and not `mycolumn1`.
    # 
    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only
    # produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of
    # producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's

    # query; this is required in order to preserve individual column timestamps for each row.
    # - When unloading, the generated SELECT statement will export each column along with its
    # individual timestamp.
    # 
    # For both loading and unlaoding, DSBulk will import and export timestamps using field names

    # If you intend to use this feature to export and import tables letting DSBulk generate the
    # appropriate queries, these names are fine and need not be changed. If, however, you would like
    # to export or import data to or from external sources that use different field names, you could
    # do so by using the function `writetime` in a schema.mapping entry; for example, the following
    # mapping would map `col1` along with its timestamp to two distinct fields, `field1` and

    # The query to use. If not specified, then *schema.keyspace* and *schema.table* must be
    # specified, and dsbulk will infer the appropriate statement based on the table's metadata,
    # using all available columns. If `schema.keyspace` is provided, the query need not include the
    # keyspace to qualify the table reference.
    # 
    # For loading, the statement can be any `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. `INSERT`
    # statements are preferred for most load operations, and bound variables should correspond to
    # mapped fields; for example, `INSERT INTO table1 (c1, c2, c3) VALUES (:fieldA, :fieldB,
    # :fieldC)`. `UPDATE` statements are required if the target table is a counter table, and the
    # columns are updated with incremental operations (`SET col1 = col1 + :fieldA` where `fieldA` is
    # a field in the input data). A `DELETE` statement will remove existing data during the load
    # operation.
    # 
    # For unloading and counting, the statement can be any regular `SELECT` statement. If the
    # statement does not contain any WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or LIMIT clause, the engine will
    # generate a token range restriction clause of the form: `WHERE token(...) > :start and
    # token(...) <= :end` and will generate range read statements, thus allowing parallelization of
    # reads while at the same time targeting coordinators that are also replicas (see
    # schema.splits). If the statement does contain WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY or LIMIT clauses
    # however, the query will be executed as is; the engine will only be able to parallelize the
    # operation if the query includes a WHERE clause including the following relations: `token(...)
    # > :start AND token(...) <= :end` (the bound variables can have any name). Note that, unlike
    # LIMIT clauses, PER PARTITION LIMIT clauses can be parallelized.
    # 
    # Statements can use both named and positional bound variables. Named bound variables should be
    # preferred, unless the protocol version in use does not allow them; they usually have names
    # matching those of the columns in the destination table, but this is not a strict requirement;
    # it is, however, required that their names match those of fields specified in the mapping.
    # Positional variables can also be used, and will be named after their corresponding column in
    # the destination table.
    # 
    # When loading and unloading graph data, the query must be provided in plain CQL; Gremlin
    # queries are not supported.

    # The maximum number of statements that a batch can contain. The ideal value depends on two
    # factors:
    # - The data being loaded: the larger the data, the smaller the batches should be.
    # - The batch mode: when `PARTITION_KEY` is used, larger batches are acceptable, whereas when
    # `REPLICA_SET` is used, smaller batches usually perform better. Also, when using `REPLICA_SET`,
    # it is preferrable to keep this number below the threshold configured server-side for the

    # i.e., if partition keys appear randomly and cannot be grouped together.
    # - `REPLICA_SET`: groups together statements that share the same replica set. This mode works
    # in all cases, but may incur in some throughput and latency degradation, specially with large
    # clusters or high replication factors.
    # When tuning DSBulk for batching, the recommended approach is as follows:
    # 1. Start with `PARTITION_KEY`;
    # 2. If the average batch size is close to 1, try increasing `bufferSize`;
    # 3. If increasing `bufferSize` doesn't help, switch to `REPLICA_SET` and set
    # `maxBatchStatements` or `maxSizeInBytes` to low values to avoid timeouts or errors;

    # - A pre-defined formatter such as `ISO_LOCAL_DATE`. Any public static field in
    # `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` can be used.
    # - The special formatter `UNITS_SINCE_EPOCH`, which is a special parser that reads and writes
    # local dates as numbers representing time units since a given epoch; the unit and the epoch to

    # Type: string
    # Default value: "ISO_LOCAL_DATE"
    #codec.date = "ISO_LOCAL_DATE"

    # This setting is used in the following situations:
    # 
    # - When the target column is of CQL `timestamp` type, or when loading to a `USING TIMESTAMP`
    # clause, or when unloading from a `writetime()` function call, and if `codec.timestamp` is set
    # to `UNITS_SINCE_EPOCH`, then the epoch specified here determines the relative point in time to
    # use to convert numeric data to and from temporals. For example, if the input is 123 and the
    # epoch specified here is `2000-01-01T00:00:00Z`, then the input will be interpreted as N
    # `codec.unit`s since January 1st 2000.
    # - When loading, and the target CQL type is numeric, but the input is alphanumeric and
    # represents a temporal literal, the time unit specified here will be used to convert the parsed
    # temporal into a numeric value. For example, if the input is `2018-12-10T19:32:45Z` and the
    # epoch specified here is `2000-01-01T00:00:00Z`, then the parsed timestamp will be converted to
    # N `codec.unit`s since January 1st 2000.
    # - When parsing temporal literals, if the input does not contain a date part, then the date
    # part of the instant specified here will be used instead. For example, if the input is
    # `19:32:45` and the epoch specified here is `2000-01-01T00:00:00Z`, then the input will be
    # interpreted `2000-01-01T19:32:45Z`.
    # 
    # The value must be expressed in
    # [`ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME)
    # format.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    #codec.epoch = "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"

    # Whether or not to use the `codec.number` pattern to format numeric output. When set to `true`,
    # the numeric pattern defined by `codec.number` will be applied. This allows for
    # nicely-formatted output, but may result in rounding (see `codec.roundingStrategy`), or
    # alteration of the original decimal's scale. When set to `false`, numbers will be stringified
    # using the `toString()` method, and will never result in rounding or scale alteration. Only
    # applicable when unloading, and only if the connector in use requires stringification, because
    # the connector, such as the CSV connector, does not handle raw numeric data; ignored otherwise.
    # Type: boolean
    # Default value: false
    #codec.formatNumbers = false

    # Strategy to use when converting geometry types to strings. Geometry types are only available
    # in DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 5.0 or higher. Only applicable when unloading columns of CQL type
    # `Point`, `LineString` or `Polygon`, and only if the connector in use requires stringification.
    # Valid values are:
    # 
    # - WKT: Encode the data in Well-known text format. This is the default strategy.
    # - WKB: Encode the data in Well-known binary format. The actual encoding will depend on the
    # value chosen for the `codec.binary` setting (HEX or BASE64).
    # - JSON: Encode the data in GeoJson format.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "WKT"
    #codec.geo = "WKT"

    # The locale to use for locale-sensitive conversions.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "en_US"
    #codec.locale = "en_US"

    # Comma-separated list of case-sensitive strings that should be mapped to `null`. For loading,
    # when a record field value exactly matches one of the specified strings, the value is replaced
    # with `null` before writing to the database. For unloading, this setting is only applicable for
    # string-based connectors, such as the CSV connector: the first string specified will be used to
    # change a row cell containing `null` to the specified string when written out.
    # 
    # For example, setting this to `["NULL"]` will cause a field containing the word `NULL` to be
    # mapped to `null` while loading, and a column containing `null` to be converted to the word
    # `NULL` while unloading.
    # 
    # The default value is `[]` (no strings are mapped to `null`). In the default mode, DSBulk
    # behaves as follows:
    # * When loading, if the target CQL type is textual (i.e. text, varchar or ascii), the original
    # field value is left untouched; for other types, if the value is an empty string, it is
    # converted to `null`.
    # * When unloading, `null` values are left untouched.
    # 
    # Note that, regardless of this setting, DSBulk will always convert empty strings to `null` if
    # the target CQL type is not textual when loading (i.e. not text, varchar or ascii).
    # 
    # This setting is applied before `schema.nullToUnset`, hence any `null` produced by a
    # null-string can still be left unset if required.
    # Type: list
    # Default value: []
    #codec.nullStrings = []

    # The `DecimalFormat` pattern to use for conversions between `String` and CQL numeric types.
    # 
    # See
    # [java.text.DecimalFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html)
    # for details about the pattern syntax to use.
    # 
    # Most inputs are recognized: optional localized thousands separator, localized decimal
    # separator, or optional exponent. Using locale `en_US`, `1234`, `1,234`, `1234.5678`,
    # `1,234.5678` and `1,234.5678E2` are all valid. For unloading and formatting, rounding may
    # occur and cause precision loss. See `codec.formatNumbers` and `codec.roundingStrategy`.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "#,###.##"
    #codec.number = "#,###.##"

    # This setting can mean one of three possibilities:
    # 
    # - The value is outside the range of the target CQL type. For example, trying to convert 128 to
    # a CQL `tinyint` (max value of 127) results in overflow.
    # - The value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral. For example, trying to convert
    # 123.45 to a CQL `int` results in overflow.
    # - The value's precision is too large for the target CQL type. For example, trying to insert
    # 0.1234567890123456789 into a CQL `double` results in overflow, because there are too many
    # significant digits to fit in a 64-bit double.
    # 
    # Valid choices:
    # 
    # - `REJECT`: overflows are considered errors and the data is rejected. This is the default
    # value.
    # - `TRUNCATE`: the data is truncated to fit in the target CQL type. The truncation algorithm is
    # similar to the narrowing primitive conversion defined in The Java Language Specification,
    # Section 5.1.3, with the following exceptions:
    # - If the value is too big or too small, it is rounded up or down to the maximum or minimum
    # value allowed, rather than truncated at bit level. For example, 128 would be rounded down to
    # 127 to fit in a byte, whereas Java would have truncated the exceeding bits and converted to
    # -127 instead.
    # - If the value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral, it is first rounded to an
    # integral using the defined rounding strategy, then narrowed to fit into the target type. This
    # can result in precision loss and should be used with caution.
    # 
    # Only applicable for loading, when parsing numeric inputs; it does not apply for unloading,
    # since formatting never results in overflow.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "REJECT"
    #codec.overflowStrategy = "REJECT"

    # The rounding strategy to use for conversions from CQL numeric types to `String`.
    # 
    # Valid choices: any `java.math.RoundingMode` enum constant name, including: `CEILING`, `FLOOR`,
    # `UP`, `DOWN`, `HALF_UP`, `HALF_EVEN`, `HALF_DOWN`, and `UNNECESSARY`. The precision used when
    # rounding is inferred from the numeric pattern declared under `codec.number`. For example, the
    # default `codec.number` (`#,###.##`) has a rounding precision of 2, and the number 123.456
    # would be rounded to 123.46 if `roundingStrategy` was set to `UP`. The default value will
    # result in infinite precision, and ignore the `codec.number` setting.
    # 
    # Only applicable when unloading, if `codec.formatNumbers` is true and if the connector in use
    # requires stringification, because the connector, such as the CSV connector, does not handle
    # raw numeric data; ignored otherwise.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: "UNNECESSARY"
    #codec.roundingStrategy = "UNNECESSARY"

    # The temporal pattern to use for `String` to CQL `time` conversion. Valid choices:
    # 
    # - A date-time pattern, such as `HH:mm:ss`.
    # - A pre-defined formatter, such as `ISO_LOCAL_TIME`. Any public static field in
    # `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` can be used.
    # - The special formatter `UNITS_SINCE_EPOCH`, which is a special parser that reads and writes

    # Type: string
    # Default value: "UTC"
    #codec.timeZone = "UTC"

    # The temporal pattern to use for `String` to CQL `timestamp` conversion. Valid choices:
    # 
    # - A date-time pattern such as `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`.
    # - A pre-defined formatter such as `ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME` or `ISO_INSTANT`. Any public static
    # field in `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` can be used.
    # - The special formatter `CQL_TIMESTAMP`, which is a special parser that accepts all valid CQL
    # literal formats for the `timestamp` type.
    # - The special formatter `UNITS_SINCE_EPOCH`, which is a special parser that reads and writes
    # timestamps as numbers representing time units since a given epoch; the unit and the epoch to

    # 
    # The default value is the special `CQL_TIMESTAMP` value. When parsing, this format recognizes
    # all CQL temporal literals; if the input is a local date or date/time, the timestamp is
    # resolved using the time zone specified under `timeZone`. When formatting, this format uses the

    # Type: string
    # Default value: "CQL_TIMESTAMP"
    #codec.timestamp = "CQL_TIMESTAMP"

    # This setting is used in the following situations:
    # 
    # - When the target column is of CQL `timestamp` type, or when loading data through a `USING
    # TIMESTAMP` clause, or when unloading data from a `writetime()` function call, and if
    # `codec.timestamp` is set to `UNITS_SINCE_EPOCH`, then the time unit specified here is used to
    # convert numeric data to and from temporals. For example, if the input is 123 and the time unit
    # specified here is SECONDS, then the input will be interpreted as 123 seconds since
    # `codec.epoch`.
    # - When loading, and the target CQL type is numeric, but the input is alphanumeric and

    # 
    # This acts as a safeguard to prevent overloading the cluster. Reduce this value when the

    # When using a checkpoint file to resume an operation, make sure that both operations target the
    # same dataset:
    # 
    # - When loading, make sure that the files to load weren't renamed or moved, otherwise all files
    # would be considered new and loaded entirely. Also, if the file contents have changed, new
    # records may go unnoticed, or cause other records to be processed twice.
    # - When unloading, make sure that the read query, the token distribution across the ring, the
    # number of splits (see `schema.splits`) and the data to read are all the same across
    # operations, otherwise the unloaded data could be inconsistent.
    # Type: string
    # Default value: null
    #log.checkpoint.file = null

    # The replay strategy to use when resuming an operation from a checkpoint file. Valid values
    # are:
    # - `resume`: this is the default option. DSBulk will only process new records from resources
    # that weren't consumed entirely. Records that were already processed will be ignored, including
    # rejected ones (rejected records are always written to bad files). This is the safest option
    # when loading if the operation is not idempotent.
    # - `retry`: DSBulk will process new and rejected records from resources that weren't consumed
    # entirely, or consumed with errors. Note that this strategy may result in some rows being
    # inserted twice and thus should only be used if the operation is idempotent.
    # - `rewind`: DSBulk will process all records (new, successful and rejected) from resources that
    # weren't consumed entirely, or consumed with errors. This effectively makes DSBulk restart
    # reading each non-successful resource from its very first record. Note that this strategy may
    # result in some rows being inserted twice and thus should only be used if the operation is
    # idempotent.

    # The maximum number of query warnings to log before muting them. Query warnings are sent by the

    # threshold configured on the server). They are useful to diagnose suboptimal configurations but
    # tend to be too invasive, which is why DSBulk by default will only log the 50 first query
    # warnings; any subsequent warnings will be muted and won't be logged at all. Setting this value

    # Whether to print record sources in debug files. When set to true (the default), debug files
    # will contain, for each record that failed to be processed, its original source, such as the
    # text line that the record was parsed from.
    # 
    # Furthermore, when loading, enabling this option also enables the creation of so-called "bad
    # files", that is, files containing the original lines that could not be inserted; these files
    # could then be used as the data source of a subsequent load operation that would load only the
    # failed records.
    # 
    # This feature is useful to locate failed records more easily and diagnose processing failures –
    # especially if the original data source is a remote one, such as an FTP or HTTP URL.
    # 
    # But for this feature to be possible, record sources must be kept in memory until the record is
    # fully processed. For large record sizes (over 1 megabyte per record), retaining record sources
    # in memory could put a high pressure on the JVM heap, thus exposing the operation to
    # out-of-memory errors. This phenomenon is exacerbated when batching is enabled. If you are
    # experiencing such errors, consider disabling this option.
    # 
    # Note that, regardless of the value of this option, DSBulk will always print the record's
    # *resource* – that is, the file name or the database table where it came from – and the
