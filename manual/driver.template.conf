# Java Driver configuration for DSBulk.
#
# The settings below are just a subset of all the configurable options of the driver, and provide
# an optimal driver configuration for DSBulk for most use cases. See the Java Driver configuration
# reference for instructions on how to configure the driver properly:
# https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/
# https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver-dse/latest/
#
# This file is written in HOCON format; see
# https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
# for more information on its syntax.
#
# Uncomment settings as needed to configure the driver. When this file is named driver.conf and
# placed in the /conf directory, it will be automatically picked up and used by default.

        # The contact points to use for the initial connection to the cluster.
        # 
        # These are addresses of Cassandra nodes that the driver uses to discover the cluster
        # topology. Only one contact point is required (the driver will retrieve the address of the
        # other nodes automatically), but it is usually a good idea to provide more than one contact
        # point, because if that single contact point is unavailable, the driver cannot initialize
        # itself correctly.
        # 
        # This must be a list of strings with each contact point specified as "host" or "host:port".
        # If the specified host doesn't have a port, the default port specified in
        # `basic.default-port` will be used. Note that Cassandra 3 and below and DSE 6.7 and below
        # require all nodes in a cluster to share the same port (see CASSANDRA-7544).
        # 
        # If the host is a DNS name that resolves to multiple A-records, all the corresponding
        # addresses will be used. Do not use "localhost" as the host name (since it resolves to both
        # IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on some platforms).
        # 
        # Note: on Cloud deployments, DSBulk automatically sets this option to an empty list, as
        # contact points are not allowed to be explicitly provided when connecting to DataStax
        # Apollo databases.
