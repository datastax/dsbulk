# Java Driver configuration for DSBulk.
#
# The settings below are just a subset of all the configurable options of the driver, and provide
# an optimal driver configuration for DSBulk for most use cases. See the Java Driver configuration
# reference for instructions on how to configure the driver properly:
# https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/
# https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver-dse/latest/
#
# This file is written in HOCON format; see
# https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
# for more information on its syntax.
#
# This file is not meant as the main configuration file for DSBulk, but rather to be included from
# the main configuration file. We recommend that this file be named driver.conf and placed in the
# /conf directory, alongside with another configuration file for DSBulk itself, named
# application.conf. Also, for this setup to work, application.conf should include driver.conf, for
# example by using an import directive. For other ways to configure this tool, refer to DataStax
# Bulk Loader online documentation:
# https://docs.datastax.com/en/dsbulk/doc/dsbulk/dsbulkRef.html

        # The driver session name. DSBulk simply calls it "driver". The session name is printed by
        # all driver log messages, between square brackets.
        # Type: string
        # Default value: "driver"
        #session-name = "driver"

        # The contact points to use for the initial connection to the cluster.
        # 
        # These are addresses of Cassandra nodes that the driver uses to discover the cluster
        # topology. Only one contact point is required (the driver will retrieve the address of the
        # other nodes automatically), but it is usually a good idea to provide more than one contact
        # point, because if that single contact point is unavailable, the driver cannot initialize
        # itself correctly.
        # 
        # This must be a list of strings with each contact point specified as "host" or "host:port".
        # If the specified host doesn't have a port, the default port specified in
        # `basic.default-port` will be used. Note that Cassandra 3 and below and DSE 6.7 and below
        # require all nodes in a cluster to share the same port (see CASSANDRA-7544).
        # 
        # Valid examples of contact points are:
        # - IPv4 addresses with ports: `[ "192.168.0.1:9042", "192.168.0.2:9042" ]`
        # - IPv4 addresses without ports: `[ "192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2" ]`
        # - IPv6 addresses with ports: `[ "fe80:0:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d:9d7b:9042",
        # "fe80:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d:9d7b:9044:9042" ]`
        # - IPv6 addresses without ports: `[ "fe80:0:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d:9d7b",
        # "fe80:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d:9d7b:9044" ]`
        # - Host names with ports: `[ "host1.com:9042", "host2.com:9042" ]`
        # - Host names without ports: `[ "host1.com", "host2.com:" ]`
        # 
        # If the host is a DNS name that resolves to multiple A-records, all the corresponding
        # addresses will be used. Avoid using "localhost" as the host name (since it resolves to
        # both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on some platforms).
        # 
        # The heuristic to determine whether or not a contact point is in the form "host" or
        # "host:port" is not 100% accurate for some IPv6 addresses; you should avoid ambiguous IPv6
        # addresses such as `fe80::f861:3eff:fe1d:1234`, because such a string can be seen either as
        # a combination of IP `fe80::f861:3eff:fe1d` with port 1234, or as IP
        # `fe80::f861:3eff:fe1d:1234` without port. In such cases, DSBulk will not change the
        # contact point. This issue can be avoided by providing IPv6 addresses in full form, e.g. if
        # instead of `fe80::f861:3eff:fe1d:1234` you provide `fe80:0:0:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d:1234`,
        # then the string is unequivocally parsed as IP `fe80:0:0:0:0:f861:3eff:fe1d` with port
        # 1234.
        # 
        # Note: on Cloud deployments, DSBulk automatically sets this option to an empty list, as
        # contact points are not allowed to be explicitly provided when connecting to DataStax Astra
        # databases.
        # Type: list<string>
        # Default value: ["127.0.0.1:9042"]

        # Note that Cassandra 3 and below and DSE 6.7 and below require all nodes in a cluster to
        # share the same port (see CASSANDRA-7544). If this setting is not specified, the default
