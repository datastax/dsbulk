For loading, when a record field value exactly matches one of the specified strings, the value is replaced with `null` before writing to DSE.

    #
    # For example, setting this to `["NULL"]` will cause a field containing the word `NULL` to be mapped to `null` while loading, and a column containing `null` to be converted to the word `NULL` while unloading.

The precision used when rounding is inferred from the numeric pattern declared under `codec.number`. For example, the default `codec.number` (`#,###.##`) has a rounding precision of 2, and the number 123.456 would be rounded to 123.46 if `roundingStrategy` was set to `UP`. The default value will result in infinite precision, and ignore the `codec.number` setting.

    # - The value is outside the range of the target CQL type. For example, trying to convert 128 to a CQL `tinyint` (max value of 127) results in overflow.
    # - The value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral. For example, trying to convert 123.45 to a CQL `int` results in overflow.
    # - The value's precision is too large for the target CQL type. For example, trying to insert 0.1234567890123456789 into a CQL `double` results in overflow, because there are too many significant digits to fit in a 64-bit double.
    #
    # Valid choices:
    #
    # - `REJECT`: overflows are considered errors and the data is rejected. This is the default value.
    # - `TRUNCATE`: the data is truncated to fit in the target CQL type. The truncation algorithm is similar to the narrowing primitive conversion defined in The Java Language Specification, Section 5.1.3, with the following exceptions:
    #     - If the value is too big or too small, it is rounded up or down to the maximum or minimum value allowed, rather than truncated at bit level. For example, 128 would be rounded down to 127 to fit in a byte, whereas Java would have truncated the exceeding bits and converted to -127 instead.
    #     - If the value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral, it is first rounded to an integral using the defined rounding strategy, then narrowed to fit into the target type. This can result in precision loss and should be used with caution.

If `schema.keyspace` is provided, the query need not include the keyspace to qualify the table reference.
    #
    # For loading, the statement can be any `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. `INSERT` statements are preferred for most load operations, and bound variables should correspond to mapped fields; for example, `INSERT INTO table1 (c1, c2, c3) VALUES (:fieldA, :fieldB, :fieldC)`. `UPDATE` statements are required if the target table is a counter table, and the columns are updated with incremental operations (`SET col1 = col1 + :fieldA` where `fieldA` is a field in the input data). A `DELETE` statement will remove existing data during the load operation.
    #
    # For unloading and counting, the statement can be any regular `SELECT` statement. If the statement does not contain any WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or LIMIT clause, the engine will generate a token range restriction clause of the form: `WHERE token(...) > :start and token(...) <= :end` and will generate range read statements, thus allowing parallelization of reads while at the same time targeting coordinators that are also replicas (see schema.splits). If the statement does contain WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY or LIMIT clauses however, the query will be executed as is; the engine will only be able to parallelize the operation if the query includes a WHERE clause including the following relations: `token(...) > :start AND token(...) <= :end` (the bound variables can have any name). Note that, unlike LIMIT clauses, PER PARTITION LIMIT clauses can be parallelized.

    # The field-to-column mapping to use, that applies to both loading and unloading; ignored when counting. If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the source fields and the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an explicit mapping. Mappings should be specified as a map of the following form:
    #
    # - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, are the zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #     - A shortcut to map the first `n` fields is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1, col2, col3`.
    # - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`, `fieldB`, `fieldC`, are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #     - A shortcut to map fields named like columns is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1, col2, col3`.
    #
    # To specify that a field should be used as the timestamp (a.k.a. write-time) or ttl (a.k.a. time-to-live) of the inserted row, use the specially named fake columns `__ttl` and `__timestamp`: `fieldA = __timestamp, fieldB = __ttl`. Note that Timestamp fields are parsed as regular CQL timestamp columns and must comply with either `codec.timestamp`, or alternatively, with `codec.unit` + `codec.epoch`. TTL fields are parsed as integers representing durations in seconds, and must comply with `codec.number`.
    #
    # To specify that a column should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the function call as the input field (e.g. `now() = c4`). Note, this is only relevant for load operations. Similarly, to specify that a field should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the function call as the input column (e.g. `field1 = now()`). This is only relevant for unload operations. Function calls can also be qualified by a keyspace name: `field1 = ks1.max(c1,c2)`.
    #
    # In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be partly auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c5`, and the table has columns `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, one can map all like-named columns and specify that `c5` in the source maps to `c4` in the table as follows: `* = *, c5 = c4`.
    #
    # One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for `c2`: `* = -c2`. To skip `c2` and `c3`: `* = [-c2, -c3]`.
    #
    # Any identifier, field or column, that is not strictly alphanumeric (i.e. not matching `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`) must be surrounded by double-quotes, just like you would do in CQL: `"Field ""A""" = "Column 2"` (to escape a double-quote, simply double it). Note that, contrary to the CQL grammar, unquoted identifiers will not be lower-cased: an identifier such as `MyColumn1` will match a column named `"MyColumn1"` and not `mycolumn1`.
    #
    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know which kinds of mapping it supports.

    # The number of token range splits in which to divide the token ring. In other words, this setting determines how many read requests will be generated in order to read an entire table. Only used when unloading and counting; ignored otherwise. Note that the actual number of splits may be slightly greater or lesser than the number specified here, depending on the actual cluster topology and token ownership. Also, it is not possible to generate fewer splits than the total number of primary token ranges in the cluster, so the actual number of splits is always equal to or greater than that number. Set this to higher values if you experience timeouts when reading from DSE, specially if paging is disabled. The special syntax `NC` can be used to specify a number that is a multiple of the number of available cores, e.g. if the number of cores is 8, then 0.5C = 0.5 * 8 = 4 splits.

    # The grouping mode. Valid values are:
    # - `DISABLED`: batching is disabled.
    # - `PARTITION_KEY`: groups together statements that share the same partition key. This is usually the most performant mode; however it may not work at all if the dataset is unordered, i.e., if partition keys appear randomly and cannot be grouped together.
    # - `REPLICA_SET`: groups together statements that share the same replica set. This mode works in all cases, but may incur in some throughput and latency degradation, specially with large clusters or high replication factors.
    # When tuning DSBulk for batching, the recommended approach is as follows:
    # 1. Start with `PARTITION_KEY`;
    # 2. If the average batch size is close to 1, try increasing `bufferSize`;
    # 3. If increasing `bufferSize` doesn't help, switch to `REPLICA_SET` and set `maxBatchStatements` or `maxSizeInBytes` to low values to avoid timeouts or errors;
    # 4. Increase `maxBatchStatements` or `maxSizeInBytes` to get the best throughput while keeping latencies acceptable.
    # The default is `PARTITION_KEY`.

    # The maximum number of statements that a batch can contain. The ideal value depends on two factors:
    # - The data being loaded: the larger the data, the smaller the batches should be.
    # - The batch mode: when `PARTITION_KEY` is used, larger batches are acceptable, whereas when `REPLICA_SET` is used, smaller batches usually perform better. Also, when using `REPLICA_SET`, it is preferrable to keep this number below the threshold configured server-side for the setting `unlogged_batch_across_partitions_warn_threshold` (the default is 10); failing to do so is likely to trigger query warnings (see `log.maxQueryWarnings` for more information).
    # When set to a value lesser than or equal to zero, the maximum number of statements is considered unlimited. At least one of `maxBatchStatements` or `maxSizeInBytes` must be set to a positive value when batching is enabled.

The value specified here should be lesser than or equal to the value that has been configured server-side for the option `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb` in cassandra.yaml, but note that the heuristic used to compute data sizes is not 100% accurate and sometimes underestimates the actual size. See the documentation for the [cassandra.yaml configuration file](https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/6.0/dse-dev/datastax_enterprise/config/configCassandra_yaml.html#configCassandra_yaml__advProps) for more information.

At least one of `maxBatchStatements` or `maxSizeInBytes` must be set to a positive value when batching is enabled.

Should be set to a multiple of `maxBatchStatements`, e.g. 2 or 4 times that value; higher values consume more memory and usually do not incur in any noticeable performance gain. When set to a value lesser than or equal to zero, the buffer size is implicitly set to 4 times `maxBatchStatments`.
