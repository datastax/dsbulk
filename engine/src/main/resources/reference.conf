For example, the default `codec.number` (`#,###.##`) has a rounding precision of 2, and the number 123.456 would be rounded to 123.46 if `roundingStrategy` was set to `UP`. The default value will result in infinite precision, and ignore the `codec.number` setting.

    # - The value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral. For example, trying to convert 123.45 to a CQL `int` results in overflow.
    # - The value's precision is too large for the target CQL type. For example, trying to insert 0.1234567890123456789 into a CQL `double` results in overflow, because there are too many significant digits to fit in a 64-bit double.
    #
    # Valid choices:
    #
    # - `REJECT`: overflows are considered errors and the data is rejected. This is the default value.
    # - `TRUNCATE`: the data is truncated to fit in the target CQL type. The truncation algorithm is similar to the narrowing primitive conversion defined in The Java Language Specification, Section 5.1.3, with the following exceptions:
    #     - If the value is too big or too small, it is rounded up or down to the maximum or minimum value allowed, rather than truncated at bit level. For example, 128 would be rounded down to 127 to fit in a byte, whereas Java would have truncated the exceeding bits and converted to -127 instead.
    #     - If the value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral, it is first rounded to an integral using the defined rounding strategy, then narrowed to fit into the target type. This can result in precision loss and should be used with caution.

    # The query to use. If not specified, then *schema.keyspace* and *schema.table* must be specified, and dsbulk will infer the appropriate statement based on the table's metadata, using all available columns. If `schema.keyspace` is provided, the query need not include the keyspace to qualify the table reference.
    #
    # For loading, the statement can be any `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. `INSERT` statements should be preferred for regular load operations; bound variables should correspond to mapped fields, e.g. `INSERT INTO table1 (c1, c2, c3) VALUES (:fieldA, :fieldB, :fieldC)`. `UPDATE` statements however are required if the table to load is a counter table, in which case the columns should be updated with incremental operations exclusively, e.g. `SET col1 = col1 + :fieldA`. Finally `DELETE` statements can be used if the load operation is meant to remove existing data, not insert new data.
    #
    # For unloading, the statement can be any regular `SELECT` statement; it can optionally contain a token range restriction clause of the form: `WHERE token(...) > :start and token(...) <= :end`. If such a clause is present, the engine will generate as many statements as there are token ranges in the cluster, thus allowing parallelization of reads while at the same time targeting coordinators that are also replicas.
    #
    # For counting, the statement must be a `SELECT` statement; the select clause must contain the table's partition key, and nothing else; as for unloading, the statement can optionally contain a token range restriction clause of the form: `token(...) > :start and token(...) <= :end`.
    #
    # Statements can use both positional and named bound variables. Positional variables will be named after their corresponding column in the destination table. Named bound variables usually have names matching those of the columns in the destination table, but this is not a strict requirement; it is, however, required that their names match those of fields specified in the mapping.
    #
    # Note: The query is parsed to discover which bound variables are present, and to map the variables correctly to fields.

    # See *schema.mapping* setting for more information.

    #
    # This setting is ignored when counting.
    nullToUnset: true

    # The field-to-column mapping to use, that applies to both loading and unloading; ignored when counting. If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the source fields and the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an explicit mapping. Mappings should be specified as a map of the following form:
    #
    # - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, are the zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #     - A shortcut to map the first `n` fields is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1, col2, col3`.
    # - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`, `fieldB`, `fieldC`, are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #
    # To specify that a field should be used as the timestamp (a.k.a. write-time) or ttl (a.k.a. time-to-live) of the inserted row, use the specially named fake columns `__ttl` and `__timestamp`: `fieldA = __timestamp, fieldB = __ttl`. Note that Timestamp fields are parsed as regular CQL timestamp columns and must comply with either `codec.timestamp`, or alternatively, with `codec.unit` + `codec.epoch`. TTL fields are parsed as integers representing durations in seconds, and must comply with `codec.number`.
    #
    # To specify that a column should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the function call as the input field (e.g. `now() = c4`). Note, this is only relevant for load operations. In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be partly auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c5`, and the table has columns `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, one can map all like-named columns and specify that `c5` in the source maps to `c4` in the table as follows: `* = *, c5 = c4`.
    #
    # One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for `c2`: `* = -c2`. To skip `c2` and `c3`: `* = [-c2, -c3]`.
    #
    # Any identifier, field or column, that is not strictly alphanumeric (i.e. not matching [a-zA-Z0-9_]+) must be surrounded by double-quotes: `"Field ""A""" = "Column 2"` (to escape a double-quote, simply double it).
    #
    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know which kinds of mapping it supports.
