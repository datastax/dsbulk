    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know which kinds of mapping it supports.
    mapping {

      # unspecified by default

    }

    # Record metadata.
    #
    # Applies within both load and unload workflows to records being respectively read from or written to the connector.
    #
    # This information is optional, and rarely needed.
    #
    # If not specified:
    #
    # - If the connector is capable of reporting the record metadata accurately (for example, some database connectors might be able to inspect the target table's metadata), then this section is only required if you want to override some field types as reported by the connector.
    # - If the connector is not capable of reporting the record metadata accurately (for example, file connectors usually cannot report such information), then all fields are assumed to be of type String. If this is not correct, then you need to provide the correct type information here.
    #
    # Field metadata should be specified as a HOCON map of the following form:
    #
    # - Indexed data sources: `{ 0 = java.lang.String, 1 = java.lang.Double }`, where 0, 1, 2, etc. are the zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and the values are the expected types for each field.
    # - Mapped data sources: `{ fieldA = java.lang.String, fieldB = java.lang.Double }`, where fieldA, fieldB, fieldC, etc. are field names in the source data; and the values are the expected types for each field.
    recordMetadata {

      # unspecified by default

  # Connector-specific settings. This section contains settings for the connector to use; it also contains sub-sections, one for each available connector.
  connector {

    # The name of the connector to use.
    #
    # It is used in two places:
    #
    # 1. The path to the group of settings for the connector are located under `connector.<name>`.
    # 2. The connector class name must start with `name`, case-insensitively. It is permitted for `name` to be the fully-qualified class name of the connector. That simply implies that the settings root will be at that fully-qualified location.
    #
    # Example: `csv` for class `CSVConnector`, with settings located under `connector.csv`.
    name = "csv"

  # Workflow Engine-specific settings.
  engine {

    # The maximum number of threads to allocate for serializing and deserializing, as well as for mapping records or results.
    #
    # Applies to both read and write workflows.
    #
    # The special syntax `NC` can be used to specify a number of threads that is a multiple of the number of available cores, e.g. if the number of cores is 8, then 4C = 4 * 8 = 32 threads.
