    # - The value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral. For example, trying to convert 123.45 to a CQL `int` results in overflow.
    # - The value's precision is too large for the target CQL type. For example, trying to insert 0.1234567890123456789 into a CQL `double` results in overflow, because there are too many significant digits to fit in a 64-bit double.
    #
    # Valid choices:
    #
    # - `REJECT`: overflows are considered errors and the data is rejected. This is the default value.
    # - `TRUNCATE`: the data is truncated to fit in the target CQL type. The truncation algorithm is similar to the narrowing primitive conversion defined in The Java Language Specification, Section 5.1.3, with the following exceptions:
    #     - If the value is too big or too small, it is rounded up or down to the maximum or minimum value allowed, rather than truncated at bit level. For example, 128 would be rounded down to 127 to fit in a byte, whereas Java would have truncated the exceeding bits and converted to -127 instead.
    #     - If the value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral, it is first rounded to an integral using the defined rounding strategy, then narrowed to fit into the target type. This can result in precision loss and should be used with caution.

    # The field-to-column mapping to use, that applies to both loading and unloading; ignored when counting. If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the source fields and the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an explicit mapping. Mappings should be specified as a map of the following form:
    #
    # - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, are the zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #     - A shortcut to map the first `n` fields is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1, col2, col3`.
    # - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`, `fieldB`, `fieldC`, are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #
    # To specify that a field should be used as the timestamp (a.k.a. write-time) or ttl (a.k.a. time-to-live) of the inserted row, use the specially named fake columns `__ttl` and `__timestamp`: `fieldA = __timestamp, fieldB = __ttl`. Note that Timestamp fields are parsed as regular CQL timestamp columns and must comply with either `codec.timestamp`, or alternatively, with `codec.unit` + `codec.epoch`. TTL fields are parsed as integers representing durations in seconds, and must comply with `codec.number`.
    #
    # To specify that a column should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the function call as the input field (e.g. `now() = c4`). Note, this is only relevant for load operations. In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be partly auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c5`, and the table has columns `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, one can map all like-named columns and specify that `c5` in the source maps to `c4` in the table as follows: `* = *, c5 = c4`.
    #
    # One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for `c2`: `* = -c2`. To skip `c2` and `c3`: `* = [-c2, -c3]`.
    #
    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know which kinds of mapping it supports.
