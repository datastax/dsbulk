    #
    # The default pattern is `#,###.##`. This format recognizes almost every input, with an optional, localized thousands separator, and a localized decimal separator. It also recognizes an optional exponent. When used with locale `en_US`, the following inputs are all valid when parsing: `1234`, `1,234`, `1234.5678`, `1,234.5678`, `1,234.5678E2`.

    # In addition to the pattern specified here, DSBulk will always recognize Java's numeric notation as valid input, both decimal and hexadecimal. Thus, regardless of the pattern being used, the following examples are always correctly parsed:

    #
    # When `true`, the numeric pattern defined under `number` will be used to format all numbers. This allows for nicely-formatted output, but may result in rounding (see `roundingStrategy`), or alteration of the original decimal's scale. When `false`, numbers will be simply stringified using their `toString()` method. This is the safest choice as it never results in rounding nor in scale alteration.

    #
    # The precision used when rounding is inferred from the numeric pattern declared under `number`. For example, `#,###.##` allows up to 2 fraction digits, so the rounding precision will be 2; 123.456 would be rounded to 123.46 with this pattern and strategy `UP`.
    #
    # The default is `UNNECESSARY` because this is the only strategy that allows to export numeric data without precision loss. Note however that this strategy will result in infinite precision and thus will print decimal numbers with as many fraction digits as required, regardless of the number of fraction digits declared in the numeric pattern in use.
    roundingStrategy = UNNECESSARY

    # The overflow strategy to use when converting from `String` to CQL numeric types.
    #
    # "Overflow" should be understood here in 3 possible ways:
    #
    # - The value is out of the target CQL type's range. For example, trying to convert 128 to a CQL `tinyint` results in overflow, as the maximum value for such type is 127.
    # - The value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral. For example, trying to convert 123.45 to a CQL `int` results in overflow.
    # - The value's precision is too large for the target CQL type. For example, trying to insert 0.1234567890123456789 into a CQL `double` results in overflow as there are too many significant digits to fit in a 64-bit double.
    #
    # Valid choices:
    #
    # - `REJECT`: overflows are considered errors and the data is rejected. This is the default value.
    # - `TRUNCATE`: the data is truncated to fit in the target CQL type. The truncation algorithm is similar to the narrowing primitive conversion defined in section 5.1.3 of The Java Language Specification, with the following exceptions:
    #     - If the value is too big or too small, it is rounded up or down to the maximum or minimum value allowed, rather than truncated at bit level. For example, 128 would be rounded down to 127 to fit in a byte, whereas Java would have truncated the exceeding bits and converted to -127 instead.
    #     - If the value is decimal, but the target CQL type is integral, it is first rounded to an integral using the defined rounding strategy, then narrowed to fit into the target type.
    #
    # Beware that `TRUNCATE` may result in precision loss and should be used with caution.
    #
    # Note: this setting only applies for loading, when parsing numeric inputs; it does not apply for unloading, since formatting never results in any of the overflow situations outlined above (but it may involve rounding – see `roundingStrategy`).

    # - The special value `CQL_DATE_TIME`, which is a special parser that accepts most CQL date, time and timestamp literals (see below).

If `schema.keyspace` is provided, the query need not include the keyspace to qualify the table reference.

    # For loading, the statement can be any `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement, but must use named bound variables exclusively; positional bound variables will not work. Bound variable names usually match those of the columns in the destination table, but this is not a strict requirement; it is, however, required that their names match those specified in the mapping.

The column names in the SELECT clause will be used to match column names specified in the mapping.

    nullToUnset: true

    # The field-to-column mapping to use, that applies to both loading and unloading. If not specified, the loader will apply a strict one-to-one mapping between the source fields and the database table. If that is not what you want, then you must supply an explicit mapping. Mappings should be specified as a map of the following form:
    #
    # - Indexed data sources: `0 = col1, 1 = col2, 2 = col3`, where `0`, `1`, `2`, are the zero-based indices of fields in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #     - A shortcut to map the first `n` fields is to simply specify the destination columns: `col1, col2, col3`.
    # - Mapped data sources: `fieldA = col1, fieldB = col2, fieldC = col3`, where `fieldA`, `fieldB`, `fieldC`, are field names in the source data; and `col1`, `col2`, `col3` are bound variable names in the insert statement.
    #
    # To specify that a field should be used as the timestamp (a.k.a. write-time) or ttl (a.k.a. time-to-live) of the inserted row, use the specially named fake columns `__ttl` and `__timestamp`: `fieldA = __timestamp, fieldB = __ttl`. Note that Timestamp fields are parsed as regular CQL timestamp columns and must comply with either `codec.timestamp`, or alternatively, with `codec.unit` + `codec.epoch`. TTL fields are parsed as integers representing durations in seconds, and must comply with `codec.number`.
    #
    # To specify that a column should be populated with the result of a function call, specify the function call as the input field (e.g. `now() = c4`). Note, this is only relevant for load operations. In addition, for mapped data sources, it is also possible to specify that the mapping be partly auto-generated and partly explicitly specified. For example, if a source row has fields `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c5`, and the table has columns `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, one can map all like-named columns and specify that `c5` in the source maps to `c4` in the table as follows: `* = *, c5 = c4`.
    #
    # One can specify that all like-named fields be mapped, except for `c2`: `* = -c2`. To skip `c2` and `c3`: `* = [-c2, -c3]`.
    #
    # The exact type of mapping to use depends on the connector being used. Some connectors can only produce indexed records; others can only produce mapped ones, while others are capable of producing both indexed and mapped records at the same time. Refer to the connector's documentation to know which kinds of mapping it supports.
